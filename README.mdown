# Capture

Capture provides a quick, dirty, and scriptable way to screenshot a collection of URLs with a given set of WebKit contexts (where a context i a screen size + user agent). Use it to get a rough idea of how your device-targeted web site looks on (say) desktop Safari, an iPad, a Nexus One, and a BlackBerry 9900. 

While the underlying rendering engine is a generic brand of WebKit, Capture can be useful as a check for general styling and features, especially for sites utilizing server-side device detection.

## Installation

Capture is a script for the [phantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) headless WebKit stack. You'll need to [install that](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions) first.

## Usage

Update the "user configuration" in capture.js as needed.

Screenshot yahoo and google:

`phantomjs capture.js http://yahoo.com http://google.com`

Screenshot two URLs after setting a cookie:

`phantomjs capture.js cookie:foo=somevalue http://mysite.com http://mysite.com/login`
